# Zero Pod Autoscaler

Zero Pod Autoscaler (ZPA) manages a Deployment resource. It can scale
the Deployment all the way down to zero replicas when it is not in
use. It can work alongside an HPA: when scaled to zero, the HPA
ignores the Deployment; once scaled back to one, the HPA may scale up
further.

To do this, ZPA is a **TCP proxy** in front of the Service load
balancing a Deployment. This allows the ZPA to track the number of
connections and scale the Deployment to zero when the connection count
has been zero for some time period.

If scaled to zero, an incoming connection triggers a scale-to-one
action. Once Service's Endpoints include a "ready" address, the
connection can complete, hopefully before the client times out.

## Status

Alpha-quality. Currently deployed successfully for some internal
use-cases. Currently recommended for use only if willing to read
and/or customize the code.

## Usage

Usage is awkward, certainly more difficult than using an HPA.

The ZPA points to an existing Deployment resource with a corresponding
Service resource and needs three main configuration parameters:

- name of the Deployment
- name of the Endpoints associated with the Service
- target address:port to which requests should be proxied (typically
  the Service name and port)

The ZPA then consists of another Deployment of the ZPA and another
Service selecting the ZPA pods. Instead of connecting to the original
Service, clients must connect to the ZPA Service resource.

Finally, the ZPA needs a service account with sufficient permissions
to watch Endpoints and scale Deployments.
